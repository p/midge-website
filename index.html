 <h2>What is Midge?</h2>
 <p>
  Midge is a system for tracking bugs found during the commercial
  development of a software product. It is particularly suited to a
  process for which the filing, managing, fixing, and testing are all
  undertaken by different roles in a trusted environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Midge aims to be consistent, self-explanatory, powerful enough to
  efficiently manage thousands of bugs, require no administration, and
  be bug-free!
 </p>
 <p>

 <h2>Principles and features</h2>
  <p>
   Key principles behind midge include:
  </p>
  <ul>

   <li>Minimise the number of states so that the user can easily make
    queries, without accidentally missing bugs.</li>

   <li>Avoid rarely used statue values (e.g. use "new" again rather
   than "reopened")</li>

   <li>Keep states as orthogonal as possible. (e.g. don't have
    a "resolved" category which is only relevent when the status is
    "closed" or "fixed".</li>

   <li>Allow some states to have values dynamically decided by the
    user (and automatically cleaned up when unused).</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
   Some key programming features of Midge include:
  </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Developed entirely in Python.</li>
  <li>Ever expanding unit test coverage.</li>
  <li>Normalised SQL tables.</li>
  <li>Multiple UIs (currently supports standalone <tt>http</tt> server).</li>
  <li>No manual database setup/teardown.</li>
  <li>Import/export API for migrating bugs to/from other systems.</li>
 </ul>
