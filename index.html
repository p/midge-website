 <h1>Midge</h1>
  <h2>What is Midge?</h2>

   <p>
    Midge is a system for tracking bugs found during the commercial
    development of a software product. It is particularly suited to a
    process for which the filing, managing, fixing, and testing are
    all undertaken by different roles in a trusted environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Midge aims to be consistent, self-explanatory, powerful enough to
   efficiently manage thousands of bugs, require no administration,
   and be bug-free!
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have any ideas, requests, or problems regarding Midge,
   please <a href="mailto:tcorbettclark@users.sf.net">send</a>
   feedback.
 </p>

 <h2>Principles and features</h2>
  <p>
   Key principles behind midge include:
  </p>
  <ul>

   <li>Minimise the number of states so that the user does not
   accidentally miss bugs.</li>

   <li>Avoid rarely used state values (e.g. use "new" again rather
   than "reopened")</li>

   <li>Keep states as orthogonal as possible. (e.g. don't have
    a "resolved" category which is only relevant when the status is
    "closed" or "fixed".</li>

   <li>Allow some states to have values dynamically decided by the
    user (and automatically cleaned up when unused).</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
   Some key programming features of Midge include:
  </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Developed entirely in Python.</li>
  <li>Ever expanding unit test coverage.</li>
  <li>Normalised SQL tables.</li>
  <li>Multiple UIs (currently supports standalone <tt>http</tt> server).</li>
  <li>No manual database setup/teardown.</li>
  <li>Import/export API for migrating bugs to/from other systems.</li>
 </ul>
